# HR Analytics

## Introduction
This document outlines the process undertaken for HR Analytics, detailing the steps taken to prepare, model, and visualize data related to employee attrition.

## STEP 1: Ensured data is well prepared, cleaned, and ready to use.

## STEP 2: Modeling
- Created a Date dimension for future date-related analysis.
- Established relationships between dimension tables and fact tables.
- Developed a measure table to create measures for attrition-related analysis and more.

## STEP 3: Visuals
- Created a dashboard with various visualizations to analyze attrition, including a column chart to display the number of employees hired by year and the attrition trends for each.
- Notably, the USERELATIONSHIP() function can be useful when you have an inactive relationship between two tables and want to present data that depends on both.
- Developed a visual displaying department and job roles to complete that overview.
